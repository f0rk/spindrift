def package(package, type, entry, runtime, destination, download=True, cache_path=None):
    """Package up the given package.

    :param package: The name of the package to bundle up.
    :param type: The type of package to create. Currently, the only valid
        values are `"plain"`, which is for simple lambda functions written in
        the standard `handler(event, context)` style, and `"flask"` for flask
        applications. Use `"flask-eb"` for elastic beanstalk applications,
        which must be flask applications.
    :param entry: A string describing the entrypoint of the application. For
        type `"plain"` applications, this should import the handler function
        itself and name it `handler`, i.e. `from yourplainapp.handlers import
        snake_handler as handler`.  For `"flask"` applications, this should
        import your application and call it `app`, i.e., `from yourwebapp.app
        import api_app as app`. For `"flask-eb"` applications, this should
        import your application and call it `application`.
    :param runtime: The runtime to package for. Must be either `"python2.7"` or
        `"python3.6"`.
    :param destination: A path on the file system to store the resulting file.
        No parent directories will be created, so you must ensure they exist.
    :param download: When `True`, whether or not to request installable
        manylinux wheels from pypi (default: `True`).
    :param cache_path: A path on the filesystem storing any currently
        downloaded wheels. Wheels will be used if found in cache. Any newly
        downloaded wheels will be stored here. Default of `None` means to use a
        temporary directory.
